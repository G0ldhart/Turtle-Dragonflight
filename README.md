# Turtle Dragonflight
A UI that brings the Dragonflight UI to Turtle WoW. I've only tested this on resolutions 1440p, 1080p, and 720p.

## Installation
#### This is a stand-alone addon made for the Turtle WoW 1.12 client.    

#### Automatic Install using [GitAddonsManager](https://woblight.gitlab.io/overview/gitaddonsmanager/)
- Click the "+" button and enter the url `https://github.com/TheLinuxITGuy/Turtle-Dragonflight.git`

#### Manual Install
1. Unpack the Zip file included with this download.
2. Copy the "tDF" folder to your AddOns folder.
3. Fire up Turtle WoW. :)

## Known issues
1. The HD textures for the empty bags icon only works when you reload the UI.
2. Debuffs show in the center of the minimap.
